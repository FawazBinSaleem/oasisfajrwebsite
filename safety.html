 <p>HSE features prominently in our planning process where 
    due consideration is given to creating safe work environment 
    for all ouremployees and other resources deployed. We practice "Target Zero Accidents", wherein every one of us carries out job safety analysis before he commences an activity, evaluates work-related risks and 
    takes proactive measures for their mitigation. The process is documented 
    and provides right to every worker to stop work if found unsafe.</p>
 <br>
 <p>Planet earth is a gift to mankind and every one of us is duty-bound 
    to keep it in a perfect shape. We highly value its importance 
    and execute our business in a way which helps keep it in a good and 
    healthy shape. We strongly 
    believe that we must leave it in a state
     better than we inherited it.</p>
